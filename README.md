# A Deep Neural Network Speech Recongnizer

## Overview
This project analyzes several different neural networks, including various types of Recurrent Neural Networks and convolutional neural networks, for their ability to take speech data and return the corresponding text. As input this project uses speech snipits from the [LibriSpeech dataset](http://www.openslr.org/12/). This work was done to complete a project for the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree (AIND). The original project instructions can be found in the `Project_Instructions.md` file.
